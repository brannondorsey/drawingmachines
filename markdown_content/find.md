###> Machine features, or, "How does it work?"

[**Uses a prism**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20a%20prism&limit=10&order_by=date) | [**Uses lenses**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20lenses&limit=10&order_by=date) | [**Uses shadows**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20shadows&limit=10&order_by=date) | [**Uses gears**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20gears&limit=10&order_by=date) | [**Uses mirrors**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20mirrors&limit=10&order_by=date)

[**Uses string**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20string&limit=10&order_by=date): Whether used as physical mainfestation of invisible perspectival vectors or as part of pulleys, string is surprisingly useful for drawing machines. 

[**Uses mechanical linkages**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20mechanical%20linkages&limit=10&order_by=date): For complex movement, stiff members connected through pivoting points provide a wide array of actions.

[**Uses a pointer**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20a%20pointer&limit=10&order_by=date): Many drawing machines convert the artist's hand movement into machine-generated drawings. Often, these machines employ an user-held pointer to trace a path. The tracing action triggers the machine to perform the drawing.

[**Uses machine-held stylus**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20machine-held%20stylus&limit=10&order_by=date): The machine holds the stylus that draws.

[**Guides artist-held stylus**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Guides%20artist-held%20stylus&limit=10&order_by=date): The machine controls or limits the stylus still in the user's hand. 

[**Uses reflections**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20reflections&limit=10&order_by=date): Different than "Uses mirrors" in that these employ partially-transparent reflections from glass. 

[**Uses a physical picture plane**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20a%20physical%20picture%20plane&limit=10&order_by=date): A board or other solid plane that "catches" the drawing. In contstructing linear perspective, vectors intersect an imaginary picture plane which is where the three-dimensional world is flattened into two dimensions. When drawing from life with a perspectival machine, there is often a flat board with your paperâ€”that's where the drawing ends up.

[**Uses a screen**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20a%20screen&limit=10&order_by=date): Not a computer screen. This "screen" refers to any flat but transparent or transluscent surface used for looking *through* to achieve a drawing. The screen is the surface that "catches" or flattens the view for easier drawing. [Sighting grids](https://drawingmachines.org/category.php?id=51) are a basic example of this. 

[**Uses a viewfinder**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20a%20viewfinder&limit=10&order_by=date): Anything you put your eye up to for stablizing your vision or focusing your scene for drawing.

[**Plots points**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Plots%20points&limit=10&order_by=date): These machines generate points on your page based on its mechanic functions. To finish the drawing, you manually connect the dots after the machine locates them.

[**Makes a projection**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Makes%20a%20projection&limit=10&order_by=date): "Projection" refers to any ghost image generated for tracing. This can include prisms, mirrors, or glass reflections, as long as the apparatus generates an image for tracing. 

[**Made from system parts**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Made%20from%20system%20parts&limit=10&order_by=date): Machines made using existing kits for assembly; Lego and Meccano, for example.

[**Is stereoscopic**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Is%20stereoscopic&limit=10&order_by=date): Machines that draw in 3D.

[**Draws orthographically**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Draws%20orthographically&limit=10&order_by=date): In design drafting, orthographic projection is used to make measured scale drawings, usually for fabrication or construction. Unlike perspective where lines converge at a vanishing point, orthographic projection maintains parallel vectors.

###> Why was it made?

[**Automated drawing**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Automated%20drawing&limit=10&order_by=date): Minimal human input. While many machines on this site reduce the human component to drawing (such as [Roulette Geometry](https://drawingmachines.org/category.php?id=31) machines where you turn the crank and the drawing comes out), the Automated Drawing tag refers to machines with which the human makes no meaningful contribution to the output. This typically refers to [pendulum-based machines](https://drawingmachines.org/category.php?id=35) where gravity does the heavy lifting (pun intended), and [surveying machines](https://drawingmachines.org/category.php?id=39) that register topography automatically.

[**Linear perspective**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Linear%20perspective&limit=10&order_by=date): During the linear perspective revolution in the early Renaissance, drawing machines were both practical tools and didactic instruments. The mathematics were complex; illustrations of machines were published to illustrate the principles behind perspectival drawing construction. These machines typically employed [strings](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20string&limit=10&order_by=date) or rods as phsyical manifestations of light vectors, or [boards](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20a%20physical%20picture%20plane&limit=10&order_by=date) and [screens](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Uses%20a%20screen&limit=10&order_by=date) as physical versions of the virtual picture plane. 

[**Draws from life**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Draws%20from%20life&limit=10&order_by=date): A machine that helps you make accurate representational drawings of the real world. From large landscapes to microscopic images, drawing from life is one of the major reasons drawing machiens exist. Artists seeking verisimilitude, scientists requiring accurate documentation or designers recording for construction have all historcially employed machines to draw.

[**Makes copies**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Makes%20copies&limit=10&order_by=date): Before mechanical reproduction began in earnest in the 19th century, making a copy of something was not automatic. These drawings machines are copiers, most of which are pre-photography.

[**Enlarges**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Enlarges&limit=10&order_by=date) & 
[**Reduces**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Reduces&limit=10&order_by=date): Making scaled copies. These two features are usually seen together; a machine that makes something bigger is likely to also have capacity to make something smaller. This does *not* include machines that by definition *must* reduce the subject, like how a camera obscura reduces real life into a small room or box. Only machines with the explicit function of enlargment and reduction qualifies here.

[**Virtual image**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Virtual%20image&limit=10&order_by=date): Ghostly projections, glass reflections, prismatic image manipulations and shadows are all virtual imagery. These machines conjur a real-time ghost image, usually for tracing. 

[**Used for design drafting**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Used%20for%20design%20drafting&limit=10&order_by=date): Design drafting requires precise and measurable scaled drawings. Most people are familiar with compasses and protractors, but this tag refers to machines that provide either specialized drawing output (like [ellipsographs](https://drawingmachines.org/category.php?id=32)) or obviate the need for complex and time-consuming drafting (like the [integraph](https://drawingmachines.org/category.php?id=36)). These machines are particularly relevant to architecture, industrial design, naval architecture, fashion, graphic design, surveying, cartography, and any field where precision in drawing is required.

[**Illustrates mathematical principles**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Illustrates%20mathematical%20principles&limit=10&order_by=date):"Illustrates" is not necessarily the best term, as some of these machines exist to *perform* mathematical functions. But to the uninitiated, these machines provide remarkable visualizations of complex mathematical principles. From geometry to phsyics, these machines take concepts typically rendered in astract formulas and manifest drawn mathematical visualizations.

[**Surveying tool**](https://drawingmachines.org/results.php?tags=Surveying%20tool&limit=10&order_by=date): These machines specialize in taking vast landscapes and precisely compressing them into measured or data-based drawings. This tag references machines with explicit surveying functions. For example, the [camera lucida's](https://drawingmachines.org/post.php?id=88) precise prism can assist the surveyor, but only [camera lucidas that have been designed for surveying](https://drawingmachines.org/post.php?id=88) receive this tag.
